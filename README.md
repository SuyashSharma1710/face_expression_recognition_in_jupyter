# Face Expression Recognition Using Python and Jupyter

![Face Expression Recognition](https://github.com/SuyashSharma1710/face_expression_recognition_in_jupyter/blob/main/assets/banner.png) <!-- Add a banner image if available -->

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

This project aims to detect and classify human facial expressions using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The model is trained to recognize various emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, and neutral in real-time using webcam or pre-recorded video feeds. This project is implemented using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## ðŸ§  Features

- Real-time facial expression detection using a webcam
- Pre-trained model for recognizing multiple emotions
- Visual feedback on detected emotions
- User-friendly interface and easy-to-run scripts

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language used for building the model and scripts.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the CNN model.
- **OpenCV**: For real-time video processing and facial detection.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For developing and running the project in a notebook environment.
- **H5 Model**: Pre-trained model in `.h5` format to speed up emotion detection.
